This was a big refactor, does $hit still work correctly????

-Is velocity reporting correctly (check riolog for first value posted and ongoing data).
-Does the autonomous start instantly?
-Can we drive a path backwards?
-Do we need to recharachterize with the gyro inverted to that the track width is accurate
    in the chracterization tool?
-Do we need to apply a 5 item median filter to the velocity to account for inaccuracies?
-Are we still going over 12 with volts?
-Are we still seeing the single instance sign flip behavior causing chain rattle on playback?
    -Is a solution to this to smooth/apply error correction to the controller output.
    -Is this because of an error with one of the input sensors that the control loop is trying to account for.
-Is the behavior once we get it working consistent even through battery changes and low batteries?
-Is the path following smooth?
-Is the path following dimensionally accurate?

-Did you get sleep??? Things look stupid when you didn't.
  // ?? Do I need to put a deadband on the encoder distance so velocity doesn't drift when the bot
    // isn't moving i.e. if distance < 0.001 set to 0????
